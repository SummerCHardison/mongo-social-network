# mongo-social-network

## Description
This is a social network application made using mongodb, mongoose, and several different npm packages. It serves as the back end of an application where users can add/delete friends, share their thoughts, and reaction to thoughts. It was made as a way to gain practice using NoSQL databases, and to better understand the code that I implemented
